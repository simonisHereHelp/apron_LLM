{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "how to make choice of ceiling fan", "assistant": "Step 1: \nWhen choosing a new ceiling fan, it's important to think about where you plan to hang it. Will the ceiling fan installation take place in a living room or are you searching for the best [outdoor ceiling fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Outdoor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z17lkr) to cool off things on your patio?  \n\nWet/damp ratings indicate whether a ceiling fan is recommended for indoor or outdoor purposes. If you plan to hang a ceiling fan inside a damp area, such as the bathroom or outdoors, you will need to find one that meets UL's wet/damp rating. A damp rating means the fan can be used in areas with excessive moisture, but covered, such as on a covered patio or in a bathroom. A wet rating means the fan can withstand direct rain, snow or excessive moisture as in an open gazebo.  \n\nTip: While an outdoor fan can be used indoors, an indoor ceiling fan should only be hung inside your home.  \n\nStep 2: Ceiling Fan Location \nWhen choosing a new ceiling fan, it's important to think about where you plan to hang it. Will the ceiling fan installation take place in a living room or are you searching for the best [outdoor ceiling fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Outdoor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z17lkr) to cool off things on your patio?  \nWet/damp ratings indicate whether a ceiling fan is recommended for indoor or outdoor purposes. If you plan to hang a ceiling fan inside a damp area, such as the bathroom or outdoors, you will need to find one that meets UL's wet/damp rating.

A wet rating means the fan can withstand direct rain, snow or excessive moisture as in an open gazebo.  \nTip: While an outdoor fan can be used indoors, an indoor ceiling fan should only be hung inside your home.\n\nStep 3: Ceiling Fan Sizes\nBecause the ceiling fan's main purpose is to circulate air and regulate the temperature in a room, it's important that your fan size matches your room size.  \nWhen deciding between ceiling fan sizes, measure the room before you purchase your ceiling fan to ensure you get the size that will be most effective for the space. Measure from floor to ceiling to determine mount type (flush, downrod, standard) for the intended location.  \nFor any room larger than this, consider using two fans to move air around the room.\nFor guest bedrooms and bathrooms, [small ceiling fans](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Small/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z1az0k) work well whereas larger spaces, like a great room, will benefit the most from [large ceiling fans](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Large-Room/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z17pyn).  \nRecommended fan width based on the length of the longest wall in your room:  \n  * Length of longest wall is less than 12 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 46 inches or less.\n  * Length of longest wall is 12 to 18 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 48 to 56 inches.\n  * Length of longest wall is more than 18 feet, your fan width or blade span should be 56 inches or more.\n\nStep 4: Ceiling Fan Mounting Type\nMeasure your ceiling height to choose the correct downrod length. Subtract 12 inches from the downrod length if your ceiling fan includes a light kit.\nIn addition to ceiling fan sizes, the mounting type you choose is extremely important. Here’s how to find the best mounting type for your room.\nWhen choosing your fan, you will come across the terms \"downrod\" and \"flush.\" Pay close attention to your ceiling height so you can determine which mounting option you need.  \nIdeally, your ceiling fan height (from floor to blade) should be 8 feet. Fans mounted too close to the ceiling will trap or move less air around the space.  \n  * [Flush mount](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Flush-Mount/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z17veu): Mounted to the ceiling, this option is ideal for rooms with low ceilings.\n  * [Downrod mount](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Downrod-Mount/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z17vgf): The best ceiling fans for living rooms or rooms with a ceiling height greater than 8 feet typically include a downrod. Very high ceilings, such as a vaulted ceiling, may need a longer downrod, so check the downrod size prior to purchasing your fan.\nIf you have a tall, vaulted or sloped ceiling, hang your ceiling fan from a downrod to lower it to the desired 8 or 9 feet from the floor. If your ceiling is sloped, check that the ceiling fan you are buying can be installed at an angle. If not, a sloped-ceiling mounting kit may be required.\nTip: When possible, hang the fan in the middle of the room and allow at least 18 inches between fan blades and the walls.\n\nStep 5: The Best Ceiling Fan Styles\nWith so many types of ceiling fans available, blades are offered in a variety of finishes, including natural, white, oak, black and more. Some blades will offer a reversible finish.  \nLight shades are usually glass, either frosted or not. Ceiling fans themselves also come in a variety of finishes, and it's best to try to match the tone to the other finishes in your room/home.\nIf your cabinet knobs are oil-rubbed bronze, choose a fan with a complementary finish. If possible, try to match your ceiling fan style and finish to your home's decor (flooring, paint and furniture colors and style). For example, a modern-style fan with a silver motor finish or black fan blades may look out of place in a home with cottage style.\n  * [Coastal](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Coastal/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0jyl2): Fans with natural wood-look blades and oil-rubbed bronze, white or matte black finishes work well. Tropical-inspired ceiling fans featuring bamboo, rattan blades and leaf-inspired designs complement beach homes and cottage-style houses.\n  * [Modern](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Modern/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0jylo): A contemporary style ceiling fan with clean lines and metallic finishes are ideal for this style home. Look for fans with a brushed nickel, satin nickel, matte black or chrome finish, as well as fans with a sleek blade design that are right at home in a loft, industrial or mid-century modern space.\n  * [Cottage](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Cottage/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0jykp): Classic white ceiling fans capture cottage style best. If this is the style of your home, look for a ceiling fan that's all-white, including hardware, or features nickel hardware.\n  * [Traditional](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Traditional/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z1bwac): Classic dark wood blades, like oak or walnut, paired with oil-rubbed bronze or brushed nickel finishes and a timeless downlight or bowl kit will blend in perfectly with a traditional-style room.\n  * [Farmhouse](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Farmhouse/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z17pru): Natural wood tones, inspired from the great outdoors, mixed with bronze or matte black hardware complement this home decor style. Look for a ceiling fan that uses Edison-style bulbs for more farmhouse appeal.\n\nStep 6: Ceiling Fan Features\nThere are certain features to keep in mind when you're shopping for a new ceiling fan. Do you need a remote control? Or are you just looking for a simple, small ceiling fan with a pull chain? How you control your ceiling fan's speed and lighting depends on the accessories included. Here are some common control options to consider:  \n  * Pull chain: A standard ceiling fans will include pull chain controls that allow you to adjust fan speed and lighting. This easy-to-reach control is ideal for areas with low ceilings or in rooms that aren't used often.\n  * Remote control: The best ceiling fans for high ceilings will likely include a remote control. Handheld and convenient, ceiling fan remotes are lightweight and portable, allowing the fan to be operated within a 30 to 45-foot range.\n  * Wall control: This option allows you to control the fan by pressing a button. It is like a remote but is secured to the wall in place of a switch.\n  * [Smart ceiling fans](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Smart-Home-Enabled/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0kirf): Fan and light settings can be controlled with an app on your smart phone or device.\n\nStep 7: Ceiling Fan Lighting\nThe majority of ceiling fans come with a light kit; however, if you are hanging the fan in an area with good natural lighting or already-installed lighting, buying [ceiling fans without lights](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-Without-Lights/N-5yc1vZcjnv) is perfectly fine. If you do choose a [ceiling fan with lights](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/N-5yc1vZcjnu), you will need to decide between these types of lighting output.  \n  * LED bulb: Consumes the least amount of energy; has an average lifespan of 50,000 hours. Bulbs can be switched out quickly for replacement or to change bulb style or color temperature.\n  * [Integrated LED light kit](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Integrated-LED/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0o8ro): LED bulbs are built into the fan. They last a decade or more with regular use. In many modules, the LED light kit can be replaced or repaired at the end of its life by contacting the manufacturer for the replace part or unit.\nTip: Remember to match your light fixture and bulb style to your home decor, if you can.\n\nStep 8: Airflow and Efficiency\nA fan motor determines its efficiency and airflow. Airflow efficiency is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air being moved. Fans either come with a [DC motor](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/DC-Motor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0sd38) or an AC motor. DC motors tend to produce less heat and consume less energy than heavier AC motors.  \nFans with high CFM, or airflow efficiency, are perfect for outdoor spaces or garages because they will circulate more air and can help keep away insects and pests.  \nIf energy-efficiency is at the top of your must-have list, look for an [Energy Star rated fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Energy-Star/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0ksr7). These certified ceiling fans use up to 20 percent less energy. Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can help reduce your heating and cooling costs.\nIt's important to note that dirty fan blades will not have a high airflow efficiency, so be sure to dust your ceiling fans often.  \nTip: In the summer, run your fan counterclockwise for a cool breeze. In the winter, run your fan clockwise to push down warm air circulating near the ceiling to better distribute the heat throughout the room.  \nYou can change the fan direction using a switch on the motor housing or a button on the fan remote.\nFrom learning how to measure for a ceiling fan to finding the best outdoor ceiling fans for your patio, we are here to help.

Bulbs can be switched out quickly for replacement or to change bulb style or color temperature.\n  * [Integrated LED light kit](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Integrated-LED/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0o8ro): LED bulbs are built into the fan. They last a decade or more with regular use. In many modules, the LED light kit can be replaced or repaired at the end of its life by contacting the manufacturer for the replace part or unit.\nTip: Remember to match your light fixture and bulb style to your home decor, if you can.\n\nStep 8: Airflow and Efficiency\nA fan motor determines its efficiency and airflow. Airflow efficiency is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air being moved. Fans either come with a [DC motor](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/DC-Motor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZ1z0sd38) or an AC motor. DC motors tend to produce less heat and consume less energy than heavier AC motors.  \nFans with high CFM, or airflow efficiency, are perfect for outdoor spaces or garages because they will circulate more air and can help keep away insects and pests.  \nIf energy-efficiency is at the top of your must-have list, look for an [Energy Star rated fan](/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans-Ceiling-Fans-With-Lights/Energy-Star/N-5yc1vZcjnuZ1z0ksr7). These certified ceiling fans use up to 20 percent less energy. Energy Star-certified ceiling fans can help reduce your heating and cooling costs.\nIt's important to note that dirty fan blades will not have a high airflow efficiency, so be sure to dust your ceiling fans often.  \nTip: In the summer, run your fan counterclockwise for a cool breeze. In the winter, run your fan clockwise to push down warm air circulating near the ceiling to better distribute the heat throughout the room.  \nYou can change the fan direction using a switch on the motor housing or a button on the fan remote.\nFrom learning how to measure for a ceiling fan to finding the best outdoor ceiling fans for your patio, we are here to help.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I choose the best engineered wood flooring for my home?", "assistant": "Step 1: What is Engineered Wood?\nEngineered wood is a manmade wood product created using wood strands, particles, fibers or veneers of wood forged together with adhesives. In the case of engineered hardwood flooring, each flooring plank is composed of several layers of plywood or fiberboard with a solid wood veneer on top. The top wood veneer gives the planks the appearance of solid hardwood, while the plywood or fiberboard core adds sturdiness and durability.\n\nStep 2: Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood\nSolid hardwood flooring planks are made entirely from a single piece of hardwood. Engineered wood flooring planks, by contrast, are made up of several layers of composite wood, with a thin veneer of solid hardwood on top. Both are great flooring options, depending on your needs.  \n  \nBecause its entire thickness is high quality wood, solid hardwood flooring can be sanded down and refinished many times. This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.  \n  \nEngineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.  \n  \nWhen it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.  \nTip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value.\n\nStep 3: Engineered Wood vs. Laminate \nEngineered wood flooring is sometimes confused for laminate flooring. However, laminate flooring consists of a synthetic veneer over a particleboard core. Its veneer is printed to resemble wood but is not actually wood. Laminate flooring has a shorter lifespan than either engineered or solid hardwood, lasting between 15 to 25 years or sometimes longer with proper care. Some people choose laminate over wood flooring because of its low cost per square foot and superior resistance to daily wear and tear.\n\nStep 4: Benefits of Engineered Wood Flooring\nThe best engineered wood flooring for your home should offer all the following benefits:\n  * Attractive appearance: To the untrained eye, engineered wood is indistinguishable from solid hardwood. Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes.\n  * Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged.\n  * Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun.\n  * Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth.\n  * Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine.\n  * Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section.\n  * Lower cost: Engineered wood flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood.\n\nStep 5: Types of Engineered Wood Floors \nEngineered wood flooring is categorized by its installation method. There are three main types of installation methods:\n  * The [adhesive installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Adhesive/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1ak5j) requires the planks to be glued onto the subfloor. This method is used to install engineered wood flooring over a concrete subfloor, especially when below-grade, such as in a basement.\n  * The [nail down installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Nail-Down/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1clg3) involves nailing through the planks into a wood subfloor. This method can’t be used on concrete subfloors and is only intended for wood subfloors.\n  * The [click lock installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Click-Lock/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1ajwk) creates a floating floor by “clicking” the tongue-and-groove planks together. No adhesive or nails are required, as the flooring simply rests over a subfloor, held down by its own weight. This method works for either wood or concrete subfloors and has the added benefit of allowing you to easily pull up the flooring as needed for repairs or replacement.\n\nStep 6: Engineered Wood Flooring Materials\nThere’s a wide variety of hardwoods that are used to create the top veneer of engineered wood flooring. Each type of hardwood has its own benefits and unique characteristics. Below are the most popular hardwoods used in engineered wood floors:\n  * [Oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11yin): A readily available wood, oak is a commonly used material in engineered wood flooring. Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. [Red oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Red-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11uq9) has pink undertones, [white oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/White-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z117p3) has yellow and gold undertones and [French oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/French-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z0m8y8) has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches.\n  * [Hickory](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hickory/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11e6m): An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern.\n  * [Maple](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Maple/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11xzp): Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory.\n  * [Birch](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Birch/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11dkr): Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch. Both varieties are equally as strong and are both more durable than oak. Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic.\n  * [Bamboo](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe): While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource.\nMany more hardwood species are available, but keep in mind that exotic wood species often require more upfront investment than other types. Also note that any type of wood can be stained a different color to fit your style.\n\nStep 7: Plank Thickness & Width \nAnother aspect to consider when choosing engineered wood flooring is the size of the planks. The thickness of the planks will affect the durability and longevity of the floor. The width of the planks affects only the floor’s appearance.  \nThickness:   \nLook for engineered wood flooring with a veneer that is at least 3 millimeters thick. Anything thinner can’t be sanded or refinished. Most veneers range between 3 to 7mm thick. Some high-quality engineered hardwoods have veneers thicker than 7mm. The total thickness of the planks can be thin, medium or thick:\n  * Thin: 1/4-inch thick\n  * Medium: 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick\n  * Thick: Over 3/4-inch thick\nWidth:  \nChoose the width of the planks based on your preferences, budget and home’s style. Narrower planks tend to be less expensive and are more common in traditional homes. Wider planks are typically more expensive and look more luxurious. They’re a natural fit for modern homes.\n  * Narrow: 5 inches wide or less\n  * Medium: 5 inches to 7 inches wide\n  * Wide: Over 7 inches wide\n\nStep 8: What to Look for When Choosing Engineered Wood Flooring\nTo find the best engineered wood flooring for your home, you should also consider the flooring’s finishes, color, texture and any extra features it can offer.  \n  \nFinishes and Features:  \n  * [Scratch resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Scratch-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191bl): The finish helps prevent scratches and scuffs from foot traffic, pets and moving furniture. Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are [dent resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dent-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191cs).\n  * UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade.\n  * [Waterproof](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Waterproof/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmdp): Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or [water resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Water-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmb3) flooring.\n  * [Stainable](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Stainable/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z181te): Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future.\n  * [Supports refinishing](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Supports-Refinishing/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1984l): If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.\nUnderlayment:  \n  * Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. [Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.\nColor:  \n  * To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood.\n  * [Light engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Light/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7p): Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily.\n  * [Medium engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Medium/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7u): These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones.\n  * [Dark engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dark/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7j): These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones.\n  * Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.\nTexture:  \n  * Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.\nWhether you want smooth or textured floors is based entirely on your design preference and ability to clean and maintain the floors.\n  * [Smooth](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Smooth/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n40): Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture. This is a popular choice in many modern homes. Smooth flooring may dent and scuff more easily than textured flooring.\n  * [Distressed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Distressed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n4s): This texture mimics the appearance of older wood and adds an air of history and lived-in comfort. Distressed floors better hides scuffs and dents. Since it looks like reclaimed wood, this texture is a great option for rustic, industrial or traditional homes.\n  * [Wire brushed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Wire-Brushed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17ngu): Wire brushed engineered wood adds subtle texture for an elegant, solid hardwood appearance. It blends in perfectly with most styles of homes.\n  * [Hand scraped](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hand-Scraped/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n41): Hand scraped engineered wood has a stronger texture than wire brushed. Hand scraping is usually one aspect of distressed engineered wood floors, since it adds an antiqued appearance. The texture’s irregularity makes the wood look more convincing as solid hardwood. This is a great texture choice for historical, traditional or rustic homes.\n\nStep 9: Engineered Wood Flooring Maintenance \nOnce you’ve found the best engineered wood flooring for your home, it’s important to know how to take care of it. Here are some tips for maintaining engineered wood floors:\n  * Sweep regularly to remove dust, dirt, pet hair and other debris. You can use a vacuum so long as the vacuum doesn’t have a beater bar or has a “bare floor” setting. Otherwise, the vacuum may scuff the floor.\n  * Mop as needed or whenever the floors begin to look dull. Use a mop that’s damp, but not soaking wet to avoid water damage. Use a soft towel to dry any spots that are still wet a few minutes after mopping.\n  * Clean up spills and any water on the floor as soon as possible.\n  * For deep cleanings, use a [cleaner](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-Floor-Cleaners-Hardwood-Floor-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb40) that's safe for engineered wood flooring. Follow the cleaner’s manufacturer’s instructions for the best results.\n  * Don’t use cleaning products with ammonia, wax or oil.\n  * Use only soft materials like a towel or microfiber cleaning cloth when applying cleaner to your floor.\n  * Minimize the appearance of scratches and prevent more damage using a scratch concealer made for engineered wood flooring.\n  * Consider putting rugs, mats or felt furniture sliders underneath chairs or other frequently used furniture to prevent scuffs and scratches on your floor.\nEngineered wood flooring has an ideal balance of beauty and resilience. It’s easier to install and maintain than solid hardwood flooring and longer lasting than laminate flooring. Plus, engineered wood floors come in so many styles, colors and textures that it can suit nearly any room in your home.  \n  \nWhen you find the right flooring for your home, remember that The Home Depot delivers [online orders](https://www.homedepot.com/c/About_Your_Online_Order) when and where you need them."}

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How to install wood flooring with engineered wood?", "assistant": "Step 1: What is Engineered Wood?\nEngineered wood is a manmade wood product created using wood strands, particles, fibers or veneers of wood forged together with adhesives. In the case of engineered hardwood flooring, each flooring plank is composed of several layers of plywood or fiberboard with a solid wood veneer on top. The top wood veneer gives the planks the appearance of solid hardwood, while the plywood or fiberboard core adds sturdiness and durability.\n\nStep 2: Engineered Wood vs. Solid Hardwood\nSolid hardwood flooring planks are made entirely from a single piece of hardwood. Engineered wood flooring planks, by contrast, are made up of several layers of composite wood, with a thin veneer of solid hardwood on top. Both are great flooring options, depending on your needs.  \n  \nBecause its entire thickness is high quality wood, solid hardwood flooring can be sanded down and refinished many times. This ability gives it a much longer lifespan than engineered wood floors. With the right installation and care, solid hardwood can last a literal lifetime, anywhere from 30 to 100 years. However, solid hardwood is prone to warping from temperature and moisture changes, so it should only be installed above-grade. Wider solid hardwood planks may also need to be glued and nailed down to a wood subfloor to prevent movement.  \n  \nEngineered wood flooring can also be refinished if it has a thick hardwood veneer. Thinner veneers typically can’t be refinished, so the flooring only has a lifespan of up to 30 years. Thick veneers can help engineered wood flooring last up to 80 years. Engineered wood planks are also sturdier and less likely to warp over time, so they can be installed below-grade and over wood or concrete subfloors.  \n  \nWhen it comes to cost, solid hardwood is typically more expensive per square foot than engineered hardwood. Higher quality engineered hardwood can get as expensive as a mid- to upper-range solid hardwood, but the labor for installing either type of flooring is usually the same and makes up the bulk of the cost.  \nTip: Both engineered and solid hardwood floors can make a home more appealing to future buyers and add resale value.\n\nStep 3: Engineered Wood vs. Laminate \nEngineered wood flooring is sometimes confused for laminate flooring. However, laminate flooring consists of a synthetic veneer over a particleboard core. Its veneer is printed to resemble wood but is not actually wood. Laminate flooring has a shorter lifespan than either engineered or solid hardwood, lasting between 15 to 25 years or sometimes longer with proper care. Some people choose laminate over wood flooring because of its low cost per square foot and superior resistance to daily wear and tear.\n\nStep 4: Benefits of Engineered Wood Flooring\nThe best engineered wood flooring for your home should offer all the following benefits:\n  * Attractive appearance: To the untrained eye, engineered wood is indistinguishable from solid hardwood. Plus, engineered wood flooring typically is available in a vast variety of colors, textures and sizes.\n  * Durable: Engineered wood flooring has a stable construction that withstands natural temperature and moisture changes. Most types can be refinished at least once if they get too damaged.\n  * Light-resistant: Most types of engineered wood floors are UV-resistant, so they won’t fade from the sun.\n  * Mold-resistant: While not all types of engineered wood floors are fully waterproof, engineered wood is more waterproof than other flooring materials. Not only does it resist warping and water damage, it also resists mold growth.\n  * Easy to maintain: Engineered wood floors are easy to clean and are usually pre-finished with a protective coating that doesn’t require additional coats of finish or shine.\n  * Multiple installation options: Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood floors can be installed below-grade, over concrete subfloors and heated floors. They can also be installed with multiple different methods, which are covered in the next section.\n  * Lower cost: Engineered wood flooring is slightly more budget friendly per square foot than solid hardwood, while still looking like solid hardwood.\n\nStep 5: Types of Engineered Wood Floors \nEngineered wood flooring is categorized by its installation method. There are three main types of installation methods:\n  * The [adhesive installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Adhesive/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1ak5j) requires the planks to be glued onto the subfloor. This method is used to install engineered wood flooring over a concrete subfloor, especially when below-grade, such as in a basement.\n  * The [nail down installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Nail-Down/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1clg3) involves nailing through the planks into a wood subfloor. This method can’t be used on concrete subfloors and is only intended for wood subfloors.\n  * The [click lock installation method](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Click-Lock/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1ajwk) creates a floating floor by “clicking” the tongue-and-groove planks together. No adhesive or nails are required, as the flooring simply rests over a subfloor, held down by its own weight. This method works for either wood or concrete subfloors and has the added benefit of allowing you to easily pull up the flooring as needed for repairs or replacement.\n\nStep 6: Engineered Wood Flooring Materials\nThere’s a wide variety of hardwoods that are used to create the top veneer of engineered wood flooring. Each type of hardwood has its own benefits and unique characteristics. Below are the most popular hardwoods used in engineered wood floors:\n  * [Oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11yin): A readily available wood, oak is a commonly used material in engineered wood flooring. Oak is a light-colored wood that has varying undertones. [Red oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Red-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11uq9) has pink undertones, [white oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/White-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z117p3) has yellow and gold undertones and [French oak](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/French-Oak/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z0m8y8) has gray undertones. White and French oak are both slightly tougher than red oak, which is more prone to scratches.\n  * [Hickory](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hickory/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11e6m): An extremely hard and durable wood, hickory is another very popular choice for flooring. It’s more durable than oak, making it a good choice for rooms with heavy traffic. Hickory is a light- to medium-toned wood with contrasting stripes in its natural pattern.\n  * [Maple](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Maple/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11xzp): Maple has an even texture and pattern, which makes it a good choice for sleek, stained floors. It’s naturally light-toned but can be stained a wide variety of colors. Note that if you don’t want to stain and finish a floor yourself, most engineered wood floors come pre-stained and finished from a manufacturer. Maple is tougher than oak, but not quite as tough as hickory.\n  * [Birch](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Birch/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z11dkr): Like oak, birch wood also comes in multiple varieties—yellow birch and red birch. Both varieties are equally as strong and are both more durable than oak. Birch is a good choice for rooms with medium to heavy foot traffic.\n  * [Bamboo](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe): While not technically wood, bamboo makes an excellent flooring material that has the look and texture of real wood. Its strength and durability can vary between manufacturers, but it’s typically more durable than the hardwoods in this list. Bamboo flooring can be refinished, stained and installed just like any other engineered wood flooring. Plus, bamboo is an eco-friendly renewable resource.\nMany more hardwood species are available, but keep in mind that exotic wood species often require more upfront investment than other types. Also note that any type of wood can be stained a different color to fit your style.\n\nStep 7: Plank Thickness & Width \nAnother aspect to consider when choosing engineered wood flooring is the size of the planks. The thickness of the planks will affect the durability and longevity of the floor. The width of the planks affects only the floor’s appearance.  \nThickness:   \nLook for engineered wood flooring with a veneer that is at least 3 millimeters thick. Anything thinner can’t be sanded or refinished. Most veneers range between 3 to 7mm thick. Some high-quality engineered hardwoods have veneers thicker than 7mm. The total thickness of the planks can be thin, medium or thick:\n  * Thin: 1/4-inch thick\n  * Medium: 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick\n  * Thick: Over 3/4-inch thick\nWidth:  \nChoose the width of the planks based on your preferences, budget and home’s style. Narrower planks tend to be less expensive and are more common in traditional homes. Wider planks are typically more expensive and look more luxurious. They’re a natural fit for modern homes.\n  * Narrow: 5 inches wide or less\n  * Medium: 5 inches to 7 inches wide\n  * Wide: Over 7 inches wide\n\nStep 8: What to Look for When Choosing Engineered Wood Flooring\nTo find the best engineered wood flooring for your home, you should also consider the flooring’s finishes, color, texture and any extra features it can offer.  \n  \nFinishes and Features:  \n  * [Scratch resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Scratch-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191bl): The finish helps prevent scratches and scuffs from foot traffic, pets and moving furniture. Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are [dent resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dent-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191cs).\n  * UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade.\n  * [Waterproof](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Waterproof/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmdp): Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or [water resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Water-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmb3) flooring.\n  * [Stainable](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Stainable/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z181te): Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future.\n  * [Supports refinishing](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Supports-Refinishing/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1984l): If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.\nUnderlayment:  \n  * Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. [Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor.

They’re a natural fit for modern homes.\n  * Narrow: 5 inches wide or less\n  * Medium: 5 inches to 7 inches wide\n  * Wide: Over 7 inches wide\n\nStep 8: What to Look for When Choosing Engineered Wood Flooring\nTo find the best engineered wood flooring for your home, you should also consider the flooring’s finishes, color, texture and any extra features it can offer.  \n  \nFinishes and Features:  \n  * [Scratch resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Scratch-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191bl): The finish helps prevent scratches and scuffs from foot traffic, pets and moving furniture. Similarly, you can find engineered hardwood floors that are [dent resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dent-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z191cs).\n  * UV resistant: The finish blocks UV rays from sunlight so the wood color won’t fade.\n  * [Waterproof](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Waterproof/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmdp): Protect against damage from spills with waterproof or [water resistant](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Water-Resistant/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1bmb3) flooring.\n  * [Stainable](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Stainable/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z181te): Stainable floors allow you to refresh or change the color in the future.\n  * [Supports refinishing](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Supports-Refinishing/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z1984l): If you want the flooring to last a long time, find engineered hardwood that can be refinished if it gets damaged or worn-looking.\nUnderlayment:  \n  * Find out if the engineered wood flooring requires an underlayment for installation. [Underlayment](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Surface-Prep-Underlayment/N-5yc1vZcdtw) is a thin material placed between the flooring and the subfloor. It helps absorb noise, adds insulation and protects both the flooring and subfloor from water damage. It also helps correct uneven subfloors. Most wood flooring requires an underlayment, but some engineered wood floors have an attached underlayment.\nColor:  \n  * To choose the color of your engineered hardwood flooring, decide whether you want light, medium or dark toned wood.\n  * [Light engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Light/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7p): Light tones brighten rooms and have an airy and open aesthetic. They’re great for minimalist and coastal styles but may show dirt more easily.\n  * [Medium engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Medium/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7u): These traditional wood tones match most home decor styles. Medium toned wood floors are the most popular choice with the widest selection of flooring. They can have warm or cool undertones.\n  * [Dark engineered wood flooring](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Dark/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z12x7j): These luxurious wood tones can make rooms feel cozy and welcoming. Dark floors are great for many styles of homes from modern to traditional. Dark wood can include cool, nearly black tones or warm red tones.\n  * Alternatively, narrow down your choice by searching for specific color families: brown, red, gray, tan, white, black are some examples.\nTexture:  \n  * Textured engineered wood flooring already has dents, scuffs and simulated damage of varying degrees on the plank surface. There’s less need to worry about actual damage from daily wear and tear. Plus, textured flooring will need less maintenance than non-textured flooring. Note that if you resurface textured floors, you’ll lose some of its initial texture.\nWhether you want smooth or textured floors is based entirely on your design preference and ability to clean and maintain the floors.\n  * [Smooth](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Smooth/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n40): Smooth floors have a sleek and shiny finish that shows a wood pattern without the surface texture. This is a popular choice in many modern homes. Smooth flooring may dent and scuff more easily than textured flooring.\n  * [Distressed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Distressed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n4s): This texture mimics the appearance of older wood and adds an air of history and lived-in comfort. Distressed floors better hides scuffs and dents. Since it looks like reclaimed wood, this texture is a great option for rustic, industrial or traditional homes.\n  * [Wire brushed](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Wire-Brushed/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17ngu): Wire brushed engineered wood adds subtle texture for an elegant, solid hardwood appearance. It blends in perfectly with most styles of homes.\n  * [Hand scraped](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Engineered-Hardwood/Hand-Scraped/N-5yc1vZb9asZ1z17n41): Hand scraped engineered wood has a stronger texture than wire brushed. Hand scraping is usually one aspect of distressed engineered wood floors, since it adds an antiqued appearance. The texture’s irregularity makes the wood look more convincing as solid hardwood. This is a great texture choice for historical, traditional or rustic homes.\n\nStep 9: Engineered Wood Flooring Maintenance \nOnce you’ve found the best engineered wood flooring for your home, it’s important to know how to take care of it. Here are some tips for maintaining engineered wood floors:\n  * Sweep regularly to remove dust, dirt, pet hair and other debris. You can use a vacuum so long as the vacuum doesn’t have a beater bar or has a “bare floor” setting. Otherwise, the vacuum may scuff the floor.\n  * Mop as needed or whenever the floors begin to look dull. Use a mop that’s damp, but not soaking wet to avoid water damage. Use a soft towel to dry any spots that are still wet a few minutes after mopping.\n  * Clean up spills and any water on the floor as soon as possible.\n  * For deep cleanings, use a [cleaner](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Supplies-Floor-Cleaners-Hardwood-Floor-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcb40) that's safe for engineered wood flooring. Follow the cleaner’s manufacturer’s instructions for the best results.\n  * Don’t use cleaning products with ammonia, wax or oil.\n  * Use only soft materials like a towel or microfiber cleaning cloth when applying cleaner to your floor.\n  * Minimize the appearance of scratches and prevent more damage using a scratch concealer made for engineered wood flooring.\n  * Consider putting rugs, mats or felt furniture sliders underneath chairs or other frequently used furniture to prevent scuffs and scratches on your floor.\nEngineered wood flooring has an ideal balance of beauty and resilience. It’s easier to install and maintain than solid hardwood flooring and longer lasting than laminate flooring. Plus, engineered wood floors come in so many styles, colors and textures that it can suit nearly any room in your home.  \n  \nWhen you find the right flooring for your home, remember that The Home Depot delivers [online orders](https://www.homedepot.com/c/About_Your_Online_Order) when and where you need them."}

The right light has a dramatic effect on energy and mood, so your wellness room should have windows.\nThink about what makes your body and soul feel better. Do you want to knock out some cardio, curl up with a good book or stretch to a lo-fi jazz track? By planning out the wellness activities you’re interested in, you can make sure you have the right equipment and enough room.\n\nStep 2: Set the Mood\nA wellness room should be a delight for all the senses. Enhance your peace of mind by layering in soft ambient overhead lighting, accent string lights and lamps with natural light bulbs. Use dimmer switches to match your lighting to your wellness activities in the evening. Treat your walls to paint colors such as muted pastels or soft earthy tones that give a sense of tranquility.\n\nStep 3: Get Personal\n  * Hang motivating elements such as meaningful art, inspirational quotes and vision boards.\n  * Add cozy texture and comfort with a vintage throw, handmade blanket or embroidered pillow.\n  * Install a sound system or use Bluetooth speakers for your soothing music playlist.\n  * Get a sound machine for calming nature sounds or white noise.\n\nStep 4: Add a Vertical Plant Wall\nFew things promote well-being and happiness like plants do.

The right light has a dramatic effect on energy and mood, so your wellness room should have windows.\nThink about what makes your body and soul feel better. Do you want to knock out some cardio, curl up with a good book or stretch to a lo-fi jazz track? By planning out the wellness activities you’re interested in, you can make sure you have the right equipment and enough room.\n\nStep 2: Set the Mood\nA wellness room should be a delight for all the senses. Enhance your peace of mind by layering in soft ambient overhead lighting, accent string lights and lamps with natural light bulbs. Use dimmer switches to match your lighting to your wellness activities in the evening. Treat your walls to paint colors such as muted pastels or soft earthy tones that give a sense of tranquility.\n\nStep 3: Get Personal\n  * Hang motivating elements such as meaningful art, inspirational quotes and vision boards.\n  * Add cozy texture and comfort with a vintage throw, handmade blanket or embroidered pillow.\n  * Install a sound system or use Bluetooth speakers for your soothing music playlist.\n  * Get a sound machine for calming nature sounds or white noise.\n\nStep 4: Add a Vertical Plant Wall\nFew things promote well-being and happiness like plants do.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I organize my closet with DIY shelves?", "assistant": "Step 1: Measure DIY Closet Space\nCrafting your own DIY closet organizer is simple. You just need enough time and a little know-how. Start by measuring accurately. Accurate measurements are the secret to building a closet organizer that works best for your space.\n  * Measure the back wall and two side walls of your closet space. (You’ll use these measurements to determine the length of the shelf supports.)\n  * Deduct 1 1/2 inches from the length of the back wall shelf support measurement. This will account for the 3/4-inch thickness of each side wall support.\n\nStep 2: Measure Pieces for DIY Closet Shelves\nYou'll use 3/4-inch [plywood](/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood/N-5yc1vZbqm7) to make this closet organizer. Measure out:\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards. The lengths will be based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two boards that are 11 7/8 inches wide. Use the length that fits the width of your closet in Step 1.\n  * Six 11 7 /8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch side pieces for the central shelf unit.\n\nStep 3: Cut Shelf Supports\nYou will install your finished DIY closet organization system on shelf supports. Cut the six 1-inch x 3-inch shelf supports you measured out of the plywood in Step 2. These pieces are for the top and bottom of the closet walls.\n\nStep 4: Cut the Shelves\nNext, measure and use a [circular saw](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Saws-Circular-Saws/N-5yc1vZc2dc) to cut the following plywood pieces for your DIY closet shelves.\n  * Six 11 7/ 8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards with lengths based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch wide closet shelves with lengths based on the closet width measurement in Step 1.\n\nStep 5: Attach Shelf Support to Wall\nYour shelf support pieces will bear most of the weight of the central shelf unit. It's important to attach them to the studs.\n  * Use a [stud finder](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Stud-Finders/N-5yc1vZc23h) to find the studs in the back wall and the two side walls of your closet space.\n  * Attach the supports for the top shelf to the walls with their top edges 84 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n  * Attach the supports for the bottom shelf to the wall with their top edges 76 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n\nStep 6: Assemble Central Unit\n  * Use [wood screws](/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws-Wood-Screws/N-5yc1vZc2bl) or finishing nails to put the center of your DIY closet organization system together.\n  * Space the shelves evenly. Or choose spacing based on the height of the items you plan to store.\n  * Leave the top and bottom of the unit open.\n\nStep 7: Place Central Unit in Closet\n  * Position the central shelf unit to be the middle of the DIY closet system.\n  * Cut any excess wood out with a [hand saw](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Cutting-Tools-Hand-Saws/N-5yc1vZc26q) so the unit fits into the support board.\n  * Take your time here and avoid removing too much wood.\n\nStep 8: Install Long Shelves\n  * Lay one of the long DIY closet shelves on the lower shelf supports. It will be on top of the central shelf unit.\n  * Attach each long shelf with wood screws or 6d finishing nails.\nTip: Add metal [shelving brackets](/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Shelving-Hardware-Shelving-Brackets/N-5yc1vZckss) in the corners of the long shelves for extra support.\n\nStep 9: Screw-In Closet Shelving Alternatives\nOne of the most popular DIY closet organization options are freestanding closet shelving. It comes in a wide range of designs and styles. Simply measure your available space and look for a unit that will fit.\n  * [Freestanding wire organizers](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Wire-Closet-Organizers-Wire-Closet-Systems/N-5yc1vZcd8r) come with one or more shelves.\n  * [Freestanding organizers in wood](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Wood-Closet-Organizers-Wood-Closet-Systems/N-5yc1vZcd8v) have a combination of shelves and drawers. These customizable closet systems have the look of built-in luxury.\n  * A [freestanding plastic closet system](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization-Closet-Organizers-Portable-Closets/Plastic/N-5yc1vZclmpZ1z0utj8) may have a hanging rod and shelves and storage baskets.\n  * Wire storage organizers can have drawers and baskets. Some are freestanding. Others hang over a door.\nChoose from basic wire storage systems to high-end wood organizers that are perfect for upscale bedrooms. Ready-made and ready-to-assemble closet organizers are also available.\nTip: Large organizers may need to be assembled. Make sure they are anchored to a wall for safety and stability. Read the instructions that come with your unit for details.\nTurn your closet into a better functioning space with a DIY closet organization system or DIY closet shelves. A closet organizer is something you can build for bedroom closets and more. Plus, building a closet system is the perfect solution for uniquely shaped closets or other odd spaces.\nBuilding a DIY closet organization system or looking for a [ready-to-assemble closet organizer](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Storage-Organization/Closet-Kits/N-5yc1vZas7eZ1z0tur0)?

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "What are the steps to build a custom closet system?", "assistant": "Step 1: Measure DIY Closet Space\nCrafting your own DIY closet organizer is simple. You just need enough time and a little know-how. Start by measuring accurately. Accurate measurements are the secret to building a closet organizer that works best for your space.\n  * Measure the back wall and two side walls of your closet space. (You’ll use these measurements to determine the length of the shelf supports.)\n  * Deduct 1 1/2 inches from the length of the back wall shelf support measurement. This will account for the 3/4-inch thickness of each side wall support.\n\nStep 2: Measure Pieces for DIY Closet Shelves\nYou'll use 3/4-inch [plywood](/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood/N-5yc1vZbqm7) to make this closet organizer. Measure out:\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards. The lengths will be based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two boards that are 11 7/8 inches wide. Use the length that fits the width of your closet in Step 1.\n  * Six 11 7 /8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch side pieces for the central shelf unit.\n\nStep 3: Cut Shelf Supports\nYou will install your finished DIY closet organization system on shelf supports. Cut the six 1-inch x 3-inch shelf supports you measured out of the plywood in Step 2. These pieces are for the top and bottom of the closet walls.\n\nStep 4: Cut the Shelves\nNext, measure and use a [circular saw](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Saws-Circular-Saws/N-5yc1vZc2dc) to cut the following plywood pieces for your DIY closet shelves.\n  * Six 11 7/ 8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards with lengths based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch wide closet shelves with lengths based on the closet width measurement in Step 1.\n\nStep 5: Attach Shelf Support to Wall\nYour shelf support pieces will bear most of the weight of the central shelf unit. It's important to attach them to the studs.\n  * Use a [stud finder](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Stud-Finders/N-5yc1vZc23h) to find the studs in the back wall and the two side walls of your closet space.\n  * Attach the supports for the top shelf to the walls with their top edges 84 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n  * Attach the supports for the bottom shelf to the wall with their top edges 76 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n\nStep 6: Assemble Central Unit\n  * Use [wood screws](/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws-Wood-Screws/N-5yc1vZc2bl) or finishing nails to put the center of your DIY closet organization system together.\n  * Space the shelves evenly. Or choose spacing based on the height of the items you plan to store.\n  * Leave the top and bottom of the unit open.\n\nStep 7: Place Central Unit in Closet\n  * Position the central shelf unit to be the middle of the DIY closet system.\n  * Cut any excess wood out with a [hand saw](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Cutting-Tools-Hand-Saws/N-5yc1vZc26q) so the unit fits into the support board.\n  * Take your time here and avoid removing too much wood.\n\nStep 8: Install Long Shelves\n  * Lay one of the long DIY closet shelves on the lower shelf supports. It will be on top of the central shelf unit.\n  * Attach each long shelf with wood screws or 6d finishing nails.\nTip: Add metal [shelving brackets](/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Shelving-Hardware-Shelving-Brackets/N-5yc1vZckss) in the corners of the long shelves for extra support.\n\nStep 9: Screw-In Closet Shelving Alternatives\nOne of the most popular DIY closet organization options are freestanding closet shelving.

Ready-made and ready-to-assemble closet organizers are also available.\nTip: Large organizers may need to be assembled. Make sure they are anchored to a wall for safety and stability. Read the instructions that come with your unit for details.\nTurn your closet into a better functioning space with a DIY closet organization system or DIY closet shelves.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How can I upgrade my closet with shelves?", "assistant": "Step 1: Measure DIY Closet Space\nCrafting your own DIY closet organizer is simple. You just need enough time and a little know-how. Start by measuring accurately. Accurate measurements are the secret to building a closet organizer that works best for your space.\n  * Measure the back wall and two side walls of your closet space. (You’ll use these measurements to determine the length of the shelf supports.)\n  * Deduct 1 1/2 inches from the length of the back wall shelf support measurement. This will account for the 3/4-inch thickness of each side wall support.\n\nStep 2: Measure Pieces for DIY Closet Shelves\nYou'll use 3/4-inch [plywood](/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood/N-5yc1vZbqm7) to make this closet organizer. Measure out:\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards. The lengths will be based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two boards that are 11 7/8 inches wide. Use the length that fits the width of your closet in Step 1.\n  * Six 11 7 /8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch side pieces for the central shelf unit.\n\nStep 3: Cut Shelf Supports\nYou will install your finished DIY closet organization system on shelf supports. Cut the six 1-inch x 3-inch shelf supports you measured out of the plywood in Step 2. These pieces are for the top and bottom of the closet walls.\n\nStep 4: Cut the Shelves\nNext, measure and use a [circular saw](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Saws-Circular-Saws/N-5yc1vZc2dc) to cut the following plywood pieces for your DIY closet shelves.\n  * Six 11 7/ 8-inch square shelves for the central unit.\n  * Six 1-inch x 3-inch boards with lengths based on the back and side wall measurements in Step 1.\n  * Two 11 7 /8-inch wide closet shelves with lengths based on the closet width measurement in Step 1.\n\nStep 5: Attach Shelf Support to Wall\nYour shelf support pieces will bear most of the weight of the central shelf unit. It's important to attach them to the studs.\n  * Use a [stud finder](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Stud-Finders/N-5yc1vZc23h) to find the studs in the back wall and the two side walls of your closet space.\n  * Attach the supports for the top shelf to the walls with their top edges 84 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n  * Attach the supports for the bottom shelf to the wall with their top edges 76 inches above the floor using wood screws.\n\nStep 6: Assemble Central Unit\n  * Use [wood screws](/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws-Wood-Screws/N-5yc1vZc2bl) or finishing nails to put the center of your DIY closet organization system together.\n  * Space the shelves evenly. Or choose spacing based on the height of the items you plan to store.\n  * Leave the top and bottom of the unit open.\n\nStep 7: Place Central Unit in Closet\n  * Position the central shelf unit to be the middle of the DIY closet system.\n  * Cut any excess wood out with a [hand saw](/b/Tools-Hand-Tools-Cutting-Tools-Hand-Saws/N-5yc1vZc26q) so the unit fits into the support board.\n  * Take your time here and avoid removing too much wood.\n\nStep 8: Install Long Shelves\n  * Lay one of the long DIY closet shelves on the lower shelf supports. It will be on top of the central shelf unit.\n  * Attach each long shelf with wood screws or 6d finishing nails.\nTip: Add metal [shelving brackets](/b/Storage-Organization-Shelving-Shelving-Hardware-Shelving-Brackets/N-5yc1vZckss) in the corners of the long shelves for extra support.\n\nStep 9: Screw-In Closet Shelving Alternatives\nOne of the most popular DIY closet organization options are freestanding closet shelving.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I refresh a room with DIY wall paneling?", "assistant": "Step 1: By: Maggie Snider\n[Your Modern Designs](https://yourmoderndesigns.com/)[More from Maggie Snider](/c/bio/maggie-snider/9ba683603be9fa5395fab9019e7d0ed6)\nMaggie Snider is the creative mind behind Your Modern Designs in Charlotte, NC. As a full-time textured artist, content creator, and DIY enthusiast, she is passionate about inspiring others to beautify their spaces with ease. Through her work, she showcases the power of practice and the right tools, making design accessible to all. Whether it's textured wall art, accent walls, or DIY makeovers, Maggie delights in creating spaces that people love.\n\nStep 2: Create Your Vision\nMaking over a room can feel like a big project, but breaking it down into simple steps can help to make even the biggest of transformations feel like a breeze, especially with the help of The Home Depot.\nFirst start your room makeover journey by crafting a vision board. Take a moment to analyze the current state of your room and think about the colors, designs, and overall aesthetic that you desire for your space.\nFor me, creating a moodboard outlining the direction I wanted my room transformation to go in was the key in my success on this project.\n\nStep 3: Prep + Painting\nPreparation is key to a successful room makeover. Begin by protecting your floors with plastic tarps to guard against any accidental paint spills. Then, choose a color that resonates with your vision.\nI opted for [Glidden’s Veil of Dusk](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Glidden-Premium-1-gal-PPG1029-2-Veil-Of-Dusk-Flat-Interior-Latex-Paint-PPG1029-2P-01F/310145521), a hue with khaki and green/yellow undertones, and it was perfect for complementing my earthy theme.\nOnce prepped, paint your walls to set the foundation for your makeover.\n\nStep 4: Calculating Measurements + Making Cuts\nMeasure twice, cut once! When planning your [box trim](https://www.homedepot.com/p/American-Pro-Decor-1-3-8-in-x-7-16-in-x-96-in-Plain-Recycled-Polystyrene-Panel-Moulding-Pro-Pack-128-LF-16-Pack-5APD10725/207038931) designs, precision is key. Begin by measuring the length of each wall and calculating the dimensions for your box trim.\nConsider factors like spacing and preferred height for each box trim element. For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.\nUsing these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.\nFor example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity.\n\nStep 5: Installing the Box Trim Design\nWith your measurements and cuts ready, it's time to install the box trim. I began by using a 5\" spacer block and leveler to ensure even spacing and alignment. I then secured each piece to the wall using my [Makita 18-Gauge Cordless Brad Nailer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Makita-18V-LXT-Lithium-Ion-18-Gauge-Cordless-Brad-Nailer-Tool-Only-XNB01Z/206278269) and 1.75\" brad nails. Work your way up from the bottom panel, using your spacer, level and brad nail gun throughout the entirety. Take your time to ensure each piece is perfectly positioned and leveled before nailing each piece!\n\nStep 6: Adding the Final Touches\nWith the box trim accent wall in place, it's time to add the finishing touches that will bring your vision to life. Handpick decor items that complement your chosen color scheme and style. From moss green velvet curtains to a mid-century modern side table, each piece should enhance the overall aesthetic of the room. Consider adding elements like this jute area rug, artificial olive tree, end-of-bed bench, and textured lamp to create an inviting and cohesive space.\n\nStep 7: The Final Reveal\nStep back and admire your handiwork! Thanks to Home Depot's curated products and decor items along with some DIY skills, this room has undergone a stunning transformation, and yours can as well. Embrace the minimal yet chic design of a box trim accent wall and inspire others to tackle their own room makeovers with confidence.\n* * *\nThis post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

For instance, I aimed for a 5-inch spacing gap from walls and baseboards, with a desired lower box trim height of 20 inches.\nUsing these preferences, I calculated the height of the upper box trim by subtracting the total spacing gaps from the ceiling height, minus the height of the lower box trim. This gave me a height of 68 inches for each piece. To calculate the width, subtract the total wall width from the number of spacing gaps, then divide by the desired number of box trim designs.\nFor example, on my 98-inch-wide wall, I wanted two box trim designs. So, subtracting 15 inches for gaps, I divided the remaining 83 inches by two, resulting in 41.5 inches for each box trim width. Apply these width calculations consistently across all walls for uniformity.\n\nStep 5: Installing the Box Trim Design\nWith your measurements and cuts ready, it's time to install the box trim. I began by using a 5\" spacer block and leveler to ensure even spacing and alignment. I then secured each piece to the wall using my [Makita 18-Gauge Cordless Brad Nailer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Makita-18V-LXT-Lithium-Ion-18-Gauge-Cordless-Brad-Nailer-Tool-Only-XNB01Z/206278269) and 1.75\" brad nails. Work your way up from the bottom panel, using your spacer, level and brad nail gun throughout the entirety. Take your time to ensure each piece is perfectly positioned and leveled before nailing each piece!\n\nStep 6: Adding the Final Touches\nWith the box trim accent wall in place, it's time to add the finishing touches that will bring your vision to life. Handpick decor items that complement your chosen color scheme and style. From moss green velvet curtains to a mid-century modern side table, each piece should enhance the overall aesthetic of the room. Consider adding elements like this jute area rug, artificial olive tree, end-of-bed bench, and textured lamp to create an inviting and cohesive space.\n\nStep 7: The Final Reveal\nStep back and admire your handiwork! Thanks to Home Depot's curated products and decor items along with some DIY skills, this room has undergone a stunning transformation, and yours can as well. Embrace the minimal yet chic design of a box trim accent wall and inspire others to tackle their own room makeovers with confidence.\n* * *\nThis post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

Through her work, she showcases the power of practice and the right tools, making design accessible to all. Whether it's textured wall art, accent walls, or DIY makeovers, Maggie delights in creating spaces that people love.\n\nStep 2: Create Your Vision\nMaking over a room can feel like a big project, but breaking it down into simple steps can help to make even the biggest of transformations feel like a breeze, especially with the help of The Home Depot.\nFirst start your room makeover journey by crafting a vision board. Take a moment to analyze the current state of your room and think about the colors, designs, and overall aesthetic that you desire for your space.\nFor me, creating a moodboard outlining the direction I wanted my room transformation to go in was the key in my success on this project.\n\nStep 3: Prep + Painting\nPreparation is key to a successful room makeover. Begin by protecting your floors with plastic tarps to guard against any accidental paint spills. Then, choose a color that resonates with your vision.\nI opted for [Glidden’s Veil of Dusk](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Glidden-Premium-1-gal-PPG1029-2-Veil-Of-Dusk-Flat-Interior-Latex-Paint-PPG1029-2P-01F/310145521), a hue with khaki and green/yellow undertones, and it was perfect for complementing my earthy theme.\nOnce prepped, paint your walls to set the foundation for your makeover.\n\nStep 4: Calculating Measurements + Making Cuts\nMeasure twice, cut once!

Now, her main goal is to inspire and encourage others to DIY. She believes there is potential in everyone, and wants to show that it is possible to any project, whether simple or complex, in their homes. \n##\n\nStep 2: A Note From The Home Depot\nAfter renovating her kitchen ten years ago, Sara Syrett of [Twelve on Main](https://www.twelveonmain.com/) thought the dark backsplash and alder wood cabinets weighed the room down. Despite a tight budget and little help, Sara completed this cozy DIY farmhouse kitchen remodel to turn the room into the kitchen of her dreams in only two weeks.\nThroughout her new kitchen, look for mixed metal appliances and hardware, an affordable subway-style backsplash and open shelving that tie this farmhouse look together.\n\nStep 3: Kitchen Remodel Checklist\n  * Paint Cabinets\n  * Add or change current backsplash\n  * Add new hardware to current cabinets\n  * Update lighting\n  * Change out kitchen sink faucet\n  * Do space planning, add or take away cabinets if needed. (This will completely change the space).\n  * New countertops\nNow, most of us cannot do all of these things. Neither could I, nor did I want to. I still loved so many things about my kitchen. I loved my countertops, so they were staying. I hated my backsplash, so it was going bye bye.\nHere is what I chose to do in my farmhouse kitchen remodel:\n  * Paint cabinets\n  * Install new backsplash\n  * Remove two wall cabinets, and replace with open shelves\n  * Update faucet\nBy choosing key elements in the room, you can strategically focus your efforts on things that will make the biggest impact. After deciding what projects I wanted to tackle, I made a supply list.\n\nStep 4: Removing the Current Backsplash\nThe first thing I did was tackle the backsplash. I had to remove the current tile, and with careful methods, I was able to save the majority of the drywall behind it.\n\nStep 5: Installing the New Tile Backsplash\nI chose to replace it with a [4 x 4 square in. white tile](/b/Flooring-Tile-Ceramic-Tile/Daltile/N-5yc1vZarszZ5zt) with a brick or subway tile pattern.\nI took the tile all the way to the ceiling. I think this attention to detail makes a big difference between having a standard look and a more custom look.\nAbove, you see it mid-project.\nAs someone who loves subway tile, this was a big decision for me. I love the fact that this tile was super inexpensive and by using a “fancy” pattern, it completely changes the feel of the tile. I chose [Delorean Grey grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-165-Delorean-Gray-10-lb-Non-Sanded-Grout-PBG16510/100095498) to compliment the tile.\n\nStep 6: Painting the Cabinet Doors\nMy cabinets were the next thing I tackled. When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.\nI chose Behr MARQUEE [White paint](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Matte-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-145001/204747469) for the wall cabinets . For the island, I decided to change it up and go with a real dark navy blue color, called [Winter Way](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-PPU25-23-Winter-Way-Satin-Enamel-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-745301/300007622). I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.\nI removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, [sanded](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a [foam brush roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.\nThe colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play.\n\nStep 7: Mixed Metal Hardware and Appliances\nThis [copper faucet](/b/Kitchen-Kitchen-Faucets/N-5yc1vZar0k) by Danze was the hardest decision I had to make and the best one, too. The shape is so timeless and classic. I love that the bridge style faucets are really popular right now.\nNow, I mentioned that I was going to take two cabinets down. I really wanted some open shelving. After all, that is what farmhouse style is all about. I decided to remove the cabinets on either sides of my range. And I know what you are saying, of course the kitchen will look good with a range like that. Well, this was my big splurge when we built our home. I knew that if I didn’t do it then, I would never do it, and so I designed the space around it. So, yes, I did have some great bones to start with.\nBy doing a little space planning and organizing, I was able to take two cabinets down without losing any storage space. One cabinet held my spices, and the other held our microwave. Both were simple to rehome.\nOnce the tile was installed and grouted, we installed the shelves. We created brackets with the [2 x 2 in. wood boards](/b/2x2/N-5yc1vZ1z0ywwl). We made sure to install them with drywall anchors and used a masonry drill bit to drill through the tile without breaking it.\nI painted the brackets white and stained the shelves.\nOnce the shelves were in, I had the ultimate pleasure of displaying all those lovely pieces that have been hiding away in cabinets.\n\nStep 8: The Completed Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel\nThis project took me two weeks to complete. And I like to think that the results are pretty spot on with what I wanted.\nI have to give myself a little pat on the back, since I told my hubby he did not need to help me, since I am the crazy one that wanted to do the farmhouse kitchen remodel. And other than one very hard to reach area, I, my little old self, did it all. So, if you think you are not good enough to do it, think again. If you put your mind to it, you can. I am proof. I am so completely thrilled with the results!\nLet’s have a few more looks at it…\nI feel incredibly grateful to be able to share this here on The Home Depot Blog. To say that I am a fan of The Home Depot is an understatement. I think most associates at my local store know me by name.\nFollow our [Kitchen Ideas and Inspiration](https://www.pinterest.com/homedepot/kitchen-ideas-inspiration) board on Pinterest to get inspired for your next project.\n* * *\nThis post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.\nThe colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play.\n\nStep 7: Mixed Metal Hardware and Appliances\nThis [copper faucet](/b/Kitchen-Kitchen-Faucets/N-5yc1vZar0k) by Danze was the hardest decision I had to make and the best one, too. The shape is so timeless and classic. I love that the bridge style faucets are really popular right now.\nNow, I mentioned that I was going to take two cabinets down. I really wanted some open shelving. After all, that is what farmhouse style is all about. I decided to remove the cabinets on either sides of my range. And I know what you are saying, of course the kitchen will look good with a range like that. Well, this was my big splurge when we built our home. I knew that if I didn’t do it then, I would never do it, and so I designed the space around it. So, yes, I did have some great bones to start with.\nBy doing a little space planning and organizing, I was able to take two cabinets down without losing any storage space. One cabinet held my spices, and the other held our microwave. Both were simple to rehome.\nOnce the tile was installed and grouted, we installed the shelves. We created brackets with the [2 x 2 in. wood boards](/b/2x2/N-5yc1vZ1z0ywwl). We made sure to install them with drywall anchors and used a masonry drill bit to drill through the tile without breaking it.\nI painted the brackets white and stained the shelves.\nOnce the shelves were in, I had the ultimate pleasure of displaying all those lovely pieces that have been hiding away in cabinets.\n\nStep 8: The Completed Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel\nThis project took me two weeks to complete. And I like to think that the results are pretty spot on with what I wanted.\nI have to give myself a little pat on the back, since I told my hubby he did not need to help me, since I am the crazy one that wanted to do the farmhouse kitchen remodel. And other than one very hard to reach area, I, my little old self, did it all. So, if you think you are not good enough to do it, think again. If you put your mind to it, you can. I am proof. I am so completely thrilled with the results!\nLet’s have a few more looks at it…\nI feel incredibly grateful to be able to share this here on The Home Depot Blog. To say that I am a fan of The Home Depot is an understatement. I think most associates at my local store know me by name.\nFollow our [Kitchen Ideas and Inspiration](https://www.pinterest.com/homedepot/kitchen-ideas-inspiration) board on Pinterest to get inspired for your next project.\n* * *\nThis post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

Now, her main goal is to inspire and encourage others to DIY. She believes there is potential in everyone, and wants to show that it is possible to any project, whether simple or complex, in their homes. \n##\n\nStep 2: A Note From The Home Depot\nAfter renovating her kitchen ten years ago, Sara Syrett of [Twelve on Main](https://www.twelveonmain.com/) thought the dark backsplash and alder wood cabinets weighed the room down. Despite a tight budget and little help, Sara completed this cozy DIY farmhouse kitchen remodel to turn the room into the kitchen of her dreams in only two weeks.\nThroughout her new kitchen, look for mixed metal appliances and hardware, an affordable subway-style backsplash and open shelving that tie this farmhouse look together.\n\nStep 3: Kitchen Remodel Checklist\n  * Paint Cabinets\n  * Add or change current backsplash\n  * Add new hardware to current cabinets\n  * Update lighting\n  * Change out kitchen sink faucet\n  * Do space planning, add or take away cabinets if needed. (This will completely change the space).\n  * New countertops\nNow, most of us cannot do all of these things. Neither could I, nor did I want to. I still loved so many things about my kitchen. I loved my countertops, so they were staying. I hated my backsplash, so it was going bye bye.\nHere is what I chose to do in my farmhouse kitchen remodel:\n  * Paint cabinets\n  * Install new backsplash\n  * Remove two wall cabinets, and replace with open shelves\n  * Update faucet\nBy choosing key elements in the room, you can strategically focus your efforts on things that will make the biggest impact. After deciding what projects I wanted to tackle, I made a supply list.\n\nStep 4: Removing the Current Backsplash\nThe first thing I did was tackle the backsplash. I had to remove the current tile, and with careful methods, I was able to save the majority of the drywall behind it.\n\nStep 5: Installing the New Tile Backsplash\nI chose to replace it with a [4 x 4 square in. white tile](/b/Flooring-Tile-Ceramic-Tile/Daltile/N-5yc1vZarszZ5zt) with a brick or subway tile pattern.\nI took the tile all the way to the ceiling. I think this attention to detail makes a big difference between having a standard look and a more custom look.\nAbove, you see it mid-project.\nAs someone who loves subway tile, this was a big decision for me. I love the fact that this tile was super inexpensive and by using a “fancy” pattern, it completely changes the feel of the tile. I chose [Delorean Grey grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-165-Delorean-Gray-10-lb-Non-Sanded-Grout-PBG16510/100095498) to compliment the tile.\n\nStep 6: Painting the Cabinet Doors\nMy cabinets were the next thing I tackled. When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.\nI chose Behr MARQUEE [White paint](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Matte-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-145001/204747469) for the wall cabinets .

I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.\nI removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, [sanded](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a [foam brush roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy). I was going to spray them, but MARQUEE brand recommends not using an air powered sprayer, which is what I have.\nThe colors went great with my current cabinet pulls. I debated whether I should get new ones, but sometimes, by picking the correct colors, it can completely change the look of them. That’s exactly what happened here. I thought they looked too outdated and rustic for the space, but against the white and blue, the copper undertone stood out. This is where the next choice came into play.\n\nStep 7: Mixed Metal Hardware and Appliances\nThis [copper faucet](/b/Kitchen-Kitchen-Faucets/N-5yc1vZar0k) by Danze was the hardest decision I had to make and the best one, too. The shape is so timeless and classic. I love that the bridge style faucets are really popular right now.\nNow, I mentioned that I was going to take two cabinets down. I really wanted some open shelving. After all, that is what farmhouse style is all about. I decided to remove the cabinets on either sides of my range. And I know what you are saying, of course the kitchen will look good with a range like that. Well, this was my big splurge when we built our home. I knew that if I didn’t do it then, I would never do it, and so I designed the space around it. So, yes, I did have some great bones to start with.\nBy doing a little space planning and organizing, I was able to take two cabinets down without losing any storage space. One cabinet held my spices, and the other held our microwave. Both were simple to rehome.\nOnce the tile was installed and grouted, we installed the shelves. We created brackets with the [2 x 2 in. wood boards](/b/2x2/N-5yc1vZ1z0ywwl). We made sure to install them with drywall anchors and used a masonry drill bit to drill through the tile without breaking it.\nI painted the brackets white and stained the shelves.\nOnce the shelves were in, I had the ultimate pleasure of displaying all those lovely pieces that have been hiding away in cabinets.\n\nStep 8: The Completed Farmhouse Kitchen Remodel\nThis project took me two weeks to complete. And I like to think that the results are pretty spot on with what I wanted.\nI have to give myself a little pat on the back, since I told my hubby he did not need to help me, since I am the crazy one that wanted to do the farmhouse kitchen remodel. And other than one very hard to reach area, I, my little old self, did it all. So, if you think you are not good enough to do it, think again. If you put your mind to it, you can. I am proof. I am so completely thrilled with the results!\nLet’s have a few more looks at it…\nI feel incredibly grateful to be able to share this here on The Home Depot Blog. To say that I am a fan of The Home Depot is an understatement. I think most associates at my local store know me by name.\nFollow our [Kitchen Ideas and Inspiration](https://www.pinterest.com/homedepot/kitchen-ideas-inspiration) board on Pinterest to get inspired for your next project.\n* * *\nThis post was created in partnership with The Home Depot.

Now, her main goal is to inspire and encourage others to DIY. She believes there is potential in everyone, and wants to show that it is possible to any project, whether simple or complex, in their homes. \n##\n\nStep 2: A Note From The Home Depot\nAfter renovating her kitchen ten years ago, Sara Syrett of [Twelve on Main](https://www.twelveonmain.com/) thought the dark backsplash and alder wood cabinets weighed the room down. Despite a tight budget and little help, Sara completed this cozy DIY farmhouse kitchen remodel to turn the room into the kitchen of her dreams in only two weeks.\nThroughout her new kitchen, look for mixed metal appliances and hardware, an affordable subway-style backsplash and open shelving that tie this farmhouse look together.\n\nStep 3: Kitchen Remodel Checklist\n  * Paint Cabinets\n  * Add or change current backsplash\n  * Add new hardware to current cabinets\n  * Update lighting\n  * Change out kitchen sink faucet\n  * Do space planning, add or take away cabinets if needed. (This will completely change the space).\n  * New countertops\nNow, most of us cannot do all of these things. Neither could I, nor did I want to. I still loved so many things about my kitchen. I loved my countertops, so they were staying. I hated my backsplash, so it was going bye bye.\nHere is what I chose to do in my farmhouse kitchen remodel:\n  * Paint cabinets\n  * Install new backsplash\n  * Remove two wall cabinets, and replace with open shelves\n  * Update faucet\nBy choosing key elements in the room, you can strategically focus your efforts on things that will make the biggest impact. After deciding what projects I wanted to tackle, I made a supply list.\n\nStep 4: Removing the Current Backsplash\nThe first thing I did was tackle the backsplash. I had to remove the current tile, and with careful methods, I was able to save the majority of the drywall behind it.\n\nStep 5: Installing the New Tile Backsplash\nI chose to replace it with a [4 x 4 square in. white tile](/b/Flooring-Tile-Ceramic-Tile/Daltile/N-5yc1vZarszZ5zt) with a brick or subway tile pattern.\nI took the tile all the way to the ceiling. I think this attention to detail makes a big difference between having a standard look and a more custom look.\nAbove, you see it mid-project.\nAs someone who loves subway tile, this was a big decision for me. I love the fact that this tile was super inexpensive and by using a “fancy” pattern, it completely changes the feel of the tile. I chose [Delorean Grey grout](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Custom-Building-Products-Polyblend-165-Delorean-Gray-10-lb-Non-Sanded-Grout-PBG16510/100095498) to compliment the tile.\n\nStep 6: Painting the Cabinet Doors\nMy cabinets were the next thing I tackled. When deciding what color to paint them, take into consideration all the other aspects in the room such as tile, countertop colors, light fixtures, and cabinet pulls. Don’t work against it all, work with it.\nI chose Behr MARQUEE [White paint](https://www.homedepot.com/p/BEHR-MARQUEE-1-gal-Ultra-Pure-White-Matte-Interior-Paint-and-Primer-in-One-145001/204747469) for the wall cabinets .

I loved the way it looked with my grey island countertop and it surprisingly went really nice with the black countertops on the wall cabinets.\nI removed all the cabinet doors, cleaned, [sanded](/b/Tools-Power-Tools-Sanders/N-5yc1vZc28s) and de-glossed them, and then painted them all in my garage with a [foam brush roller](/b/Paint-Paint-Supplies-Paint-Applicators-Paint-Rollers/N-5yc1vZaqpy).

This is where the next choice came into play.\n\nStep 7: Mixed Metal Hardware and Appliances\nThis [copper faucet](/b/Kitchen-Kitchen-Faucets/N-5yc1vZar0k) by Danze was the hardest decision I had to make and the best one, too.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I remove and install new flooring myself?", "assistant": "Step 1: A Note From The Home Depot\nFrom bathrooms to basements, updating the floors in your home is a big project that can transform any space. Depending on your home's age and the flooring type you need to remove and install, this DIY project will take a few weekends to complete. But whether you rent or purchase the tools and equipment, it won’t break your budget. Follow our quick tips for DIY flooring removal and installation.\n[RENT FLOOR REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION EQUIPMENT](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_care_and_refinishing_equipment_rental#floor-strippers)\n\nStep 2: Flooring Removal 101\nFlooring removal can be a tough job. But The Home Depot’s one-stop shop can cover everything you need, like rental tools and equipment, materials and flooring.\n\nStep 3: Step 1: Safety\nThe first step in a flooring removal project is to assess the safety of the flooring you’re pulling up. If you’re remodeling an older fixer-upper that had vinyl or linoleum flooring installed prior to 1980, it may contain asbestos. In this case, you’ll need to contact a local asbestos abatement officer to test the flooring. Flooring that is contaminated with asbestos is best left to the professionals.\n\nStep 4: Step 2: Clear the Area and Prep the Room\nNext, empty the room of furniture and appliances. If you’re removing the flooring in a kitchen or bathroom, turn off water supplies. You should also remove all appliances, like refrigerators, ovens, pedestal sinks, vanities and toilets.\nOnce the room is empty, carefully remove the baseboards from the wall with a trim puller. You may prefer to use a prybar and rubber mallet. Little by little, work the trim free from the wall. If you plan to reuse the trim, mark the back with its location in the room. You can then reinstall it after your new flooring installation.\n\nStep 5: Step 3: Removing Flooring\nEvery type of flooring removal is different. Here’s how to tackle your project, whether you have laminate, tile or carpet.\nLaminate:\n  * Start in the middle of the room when removing laminate flooring.\n  * Use a utility knife to cut down the middle of the flooring.\n  * Make secondary cuts in strips, 12 inches parallel to the first cut.\n  * Gently lift one end of the flooring and roll the strips up for disposal.\n  * Use a prybar to help lift stuck flooring.\nNote: If you want to finish the job even faster, consider a floor stripper rental. A [pro flooring stripper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/General-Equipment-PRO-Floor-Stripper-FCS16/316821984) can remove large amounts of laminate or vinyl flooring at one time.\nTile: Removing tile takes a bit more heavy-duty demo work. However, you can break up the tile as you go. Use a combination of a [breaker](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-Small-Breaker-HM1307CB/316822071) and [hammer cart](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Pearl-Abrasive-Co-Easy-Hammer-Cart-For-Small-Breaker-PA01HT/316821930) for large areas. For tight spots, you can use a [demo hammer rental](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-20-LB-Demolition-Hammer-HM1203C/316821942).\nCarpet: Removing carpet is the easiest flooring to strip.\n  * Pick a corner and use a strong set of pliers to pull it from the tack strip.\n  * Continue pulling the carpet, cutting it into long strips. Then, roll it up and haul it away.\n  * Continue the same process for the padding underneath.\n  * Don’t forget to pull up the tack strips around the border of the room once you’re finished.\n\nStep 6: Step 4: Remove Adhesive and Mortar\nIf you tackle flooring removal with laminate or tile, you may find residual adhesive and mortar left over on the subfloor.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "What’s the best DIY method to update old floors?", "assistant": "Step 1: A Note From The Home Depot\nFrom bathrooms to basements, updating the floors in your home is a big project that can transform any space. Depending on your home's age and the flooring type you need to remove and install, this DIY project will take a few weekends to complete. But whether you rent or purchase the tools and equipment, it won’t break your budget. Follow our quick tips for DIY flooring removal and installation.\n[RENT FLOOR REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION EQUIPMENT](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_care_and_refinishing_equipment_rental#floor-strippers)\n\nStep 2: Flooring Removal 101\nFlooring removal can be a tough job. But The Home Depot’s one-stop shop can cover everything you need, like rental tools and equipment, materials and flooring.\n\nStep 3: Step 1: Safety\nThe first step in a flooring removal project is to assess the safety of the flooring you’re pulling up. If you’re remodeling an older fixer-upper that had vinyl or linoleum flooring installed prior to 1980, it may contain asbestos. In this case, you’ll need to contact a local asbestos abatement officer to test the flooring. Flooring that is contaminated with asbestos is best left to the professionals.\n\nStep 4: Step 2: Clear the Area and Prep the Room\nNext, empty the room of furniture and appliances. If you’re removing the flooring in a kitchen or bathroom, turn off water supplies. You should also remove all appliances, like refrigerators, ovens, pedestal sinks, vanities and toilets.\nOnce the room is empty, carefully remove the baseboards from the wall with a trim puller. You may prefer to use a prybar and rubber mallet. Little by little, work the trim free from the wall. If you plan to reuse the trim, mark the back with its location in the room. You can then reinstall it after your new flooring installation.\n\nStep 5: Step 3: Removing Flooring\nEvery type of flooring removal is different. Here’s how to tackle your project, whether you have laminate, tile or carpet.\nLaminate:\n  * Start in the middle of the room when removing laminate flooring.\n  * Use a utility knife to cut down the middle of the flooring.\n  * Make secondary cuts in strips, 12 inches parallel to the first cut.\n  * Gently lift one end of the flooring and roll the strips up for disposal.\n  * Use a prybar to help lift stuck flooring.\nNote: If you want to finish the job even faster, consider a floor stripper rental. A [pro flooring stripper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/General-Equipment-PRO-Floor-Stripper-FCS16/316821984) can remove large amounts of laminate or vinyl flooring at one time.\nTile: Removing tile takes a bit more heavy-duty demo work. However, you can break up the tile as you go. Use a combination of a [breaker](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-Small-Breaker-HM1307CB/316822071) and [hammer cart](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Pearl-Abrasive-Co-Easy-Hammer-Cart-For-Small-Breaker-PA01HT/316821930) for large areas. For tight spots, you can use a [demo hammer rental](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-20-LB-Demolition-Hammer-HM1203C/316821942).\nCarpet: Removing carpet is the easiest flooring to strip.\n  * Pick a corner and use a strong set of pliers to pull it from the tack strip.\n  * Continue pulling the carpet, cutting it into long strips. Then, roll it up and haul it away.\n  * Continue the same process for the padding underneath.\n  * Don’t forget to pull up the tack strips around the border of the room once you’re finished.\n\nStep 6: Step 4: Remove Adhesive and Mortar\nIf you tackle flooring removal with laminate or tile, you may find residual adhesive and mortar left over on the subfloor. Depending on the subfloor type underneath, a [floor stripper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/General-Equipment-PRO-Floor-Stripper-FCS16/316821984) or [floor maintainer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Clarke-American-Sanders-Floor-Maintainer-01278A/316821426) with the proper [attachment](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_care_and_refinishing_equipment_rental#coating-removal) can make quick work of the task.\n\nStep 7: Install Flooring with Rental Equipment \nA new flooring installation can transform any space.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How to use rental tools for removing and laying floors?", "assistant": "Step 1: A Note From The Home Depot\nFrom bathrooms to basements, updating the floors in your home is a big project that can transform any space. Depending on your home's age and the flooring type you need to remove and install, this DIY project will take a few weekends to complete. But whether you rent or purchase the tools and equipment, it won’t break your budget. Follow our quick tips for DIY flooring removal and installation.\n[RENT FLOOR REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION EQUIPMENT](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_care_and_refinishing_equipment_rental#floor-strippers)\n\nStep 2: Flooring Removal 101\nFlooring removal can be a tough job. But The Home Depot’s one-stop shop can cover everything you need, like rental tools and equipment, materials and flooring.\n\nStep 3: Step 1: Safety\nThe first step in a flooring removal project is to assess the safety of the flooring you’re pulling up. If you’re remodeling an older fixer-upper that had vinyl or linoleum flooring installed prior to 1980, it may contain asbestos. In this case, you’ll need to contact a local asbestos abatement officer to test the flooring. Flooring that is contaminated with asbestos is best left to the professionals.\n\nStep 4: Step 2: Clear the Area and Prep the Room\nNext, empty the room of furniture and appliances. If you’re removing the flooring in a kitchen or bathroom, turn off water supplies. You should also remove all appliances, like refrigerators, ovens, pedestal sinks, vanities and toilets.\nOnce the room is empty, carefully remove the baseboards from the wall with a trim puller. You may prefer to use a prybar and rubber mallet. Little by little, work the trim free from the wall. If you plan to reuse the trim, mark the back with its location in the room. You can then reinstall it after your new flooring installation.\n\nStep 5: Step 3: Removing Flooring\nEvery type of flooring removal is different. Here’s how to tackle your project, whether you have laminate, tile or carpet.\nLaminate:\n  * Start in the middle of the room when removing laminate flooring.\n  * Use a utility knife to cut down the middle of the flooring.\n  * Make secondary cuts in strips, 12 inches parallel to the first cut.\n  * Gently lift one end of the flooring and roll the strips up for disposal.\n  * Use a prybar to help lift stuck flooring.\nNote: If you want to finish the job even faster, consider a floor stripper rental. A [pro flooring stripper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/General-Equipment-PRO-Floor-Stripper-FCS16/316821984) can remove large amounts of laminate or vinyl flooring at one time.\nTile: Removing tile takes a bit more heavy-duty demo work. However, you can break up the tile as you go. Use a combination of a [breaker](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-Small-Breaker-HM1307CB/316822071) and [hammer cart](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Pearl-Abrasive-Co-Easy-Hammer-Cart-For-Small-Breaker-PA01HT/316821930) for large areas. For tight spots, you can use a [demo hammer rental](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Makita-20-LB-Demolition-Hammer-HM1203C/316821942).\nCarpet: Removing carpet is the easiest flooring to strip.\n  * Pick a corner and use a strong set of pliers to pull it from the tack strip.\n  * Continue pulling the carpet, cutting it into long strips. Then, roll it up and haul it away.\n  * Continue the same process for the padding underneath.\n  * Don’t forget to pull up the tack strips around the border of the room once you’re finished.\n\nStep 6: Step 4: Remove Adhesive and Mortar\nIf you tackle flooring removal with laminate or tile, you may find residual adhesive and mortar left over on the subfloor. Depending on the subfloor type underneath, a [floor stripper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/General-Equipment-PRO-Floor-Stripper-FCS16/316821984) or [floor maintainer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/Clarke-American-Sanders-Floor-Maintainer-01278A/316821426) with the proper [attachment](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_care_and_refinishing_equipment_rental#coating-removal) can make quick work of the task.\n\nStep 7: Install Flooring with Rental Equipment \nA new flooring installation can transform any space. Depending on the room size, this DIY project may take a weekend, or a few weeks to complete. You won't break your budget when purchasing the new flooring and materials.\nEven better, The Home Depot carries the [rental installation equipment](https://www.homedepot.com/c/floor_cleaning_equipment_rental) you need, like floor strippers and attachments. But be sure to always consult the operations manual before using your rental equipment.\nIf you’re installing tile, rent [tile saws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/rental/MK-Diamond-Products-or-Pearl-Abrasive-Small-Tile-Saw-MK-660R-or-PA7RKIT/316821914) to make fast and easy cuts.

This disguised the entrance and gave the space an exclusive, tucked-away feel—just like a real speakeasy. The before is a terror! But the after is a dream!\n\nStep 3: Setting the Mood with Color & Lighting\nTo bring my vision to life, I knew I needed deep, moody hues to set the tone.

The mix of textures—soft velvet, sleek marble and warm wood—added depth and sophistication.\n\nStep 6: A Total Flooring Transformation\nThe biggest game-changer? New flooring. The old, outdated floors needed a serious facelift, so I installed click-lock LVP flooring. As a beginner DIY’er, I was thrilled at how easy the process was! The result?

Her mission is to empower others to reimagine their homes with confidence and heart.\n\nStep 2: A Secret Entrance for a True Speakeasy Feel\nWhat’s a speakeasy without a little mystery? To enhance the theme, I created a hidden entrance by installing [wooden acoustic paneling](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Wood-Slat-Acoustic-Wall-Panels-2PC-Brown-0-83-in-x-23-8-in-x-94-5-in-31-Sq-Ft-Case-JM1114-624-B111/325911848 \"Everbilt Wood Slat Acoustic Wall Panels 2PC Brown 0.83 in. x 23.8 in x 94.5 in.\\(31 Sq.Ft./Case\\)\") on both the door and the surrounding wall.

This disguised the entrance and gave the space an exclusive, tucked-away feel—just like a real speakeasy. The before is a terror! But the after is a dream!\n\nStep 3: Setting the Mood with Color & Lighting\nTo bring my vision to life, I knew I needed deep, moody hues to set the tone.

This not only added function but also enhanced the ambiance, making the space feel high-end yet inviting.\n\nStep 5: Lounge-Worthy Seating\nComfort was a top priority and I found the perfect [curved velvet couch](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HOMEFUN-126-in-Straight-Arm-Chenille-Curved-Modular-Large-Sectional-Sofa-Oversized-Couch-Sofa-with-Pillows-in-Wine-Red-HFHDSN-1005RD/332599376 \"HOMEFUN 126 in.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I clean grout between tiles effectively?", "assistant": "Step 1: Apply Grout Cleaner\n  * Wear [gloves](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Rubber-Gloves/N-5yc1vZcb34) to protect your hands when cleaning grout and tile.\n  * Clean grout with a commercial [grout and tile cleaner](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products-Bathroom-Cleaners-Grout-Tile-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcba0). Apply it to the dirty areas of the grout following the manufacturer's instructions.\n  * If you prefer cleaning grout with a DIY mixture, make a paste of 3/4-cup baking soda, 1/4-cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Apply the paste to the grout with a [grout brush](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Cleaning-Brushes-Scrub-Brushes/Tile-and-Grout-Brush/N-5yc1vZcb49Z1z0pidd) and scrub the grout. Grout brushes have compact heads and dense, firm bristles to help loosen the grime that builds up in the grooves.\n  * Do not use acidic cleaners as they may dissolve or pit the grout. Do not use waxy or oil-based cleaners as these can leave a film that will attract dirt and make future cleaning more difficult.\n  * Chlorine bleach may be used on white grout but will leach color out of tinted grout. [Oxygen bleach](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products-Bleach/N-5yc1vZcb5b) is a better choice for preserving colored grout between tiles.\n\nStep 2: Scrub and Rinse Grout\nUse a [sponge](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Sponges-Scouring-Pads/N-5yc1vZcb3k), cleaning rags or [microfiber cloths](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Cleaning-Cloths-Microfiber-Towels/N-5yc1vZcb2l) to rinse and wipe each area after cleaning. Be sure no residue is left from the grout cleaner. If you are cleaning grout and tiles on a floor, mop the entire floor when finished.\n\nStep 3: How to Clean Grout with Stubborn Stains\nGive old or stubborn stains extra attention.\n  * For stains that regular cleaning can't remove, thoroughly mix 2 tablespoons of oxygenated bleach into 2 cups of warm water. Test the solution on a hidden area of grout to be sure it won’t discolor.\n  * Pour the solution over a small area of stained grout lines. It's best to work in small sections and make more solution as needed.\n  * Allow the cleaner to sit for up to 15 minutes to give the ingredients time to work, then scrub and rinse until all the cleaner is removed. Use firm pressure and make several passes over each grout line.\n  * Assemble and load the steam cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use only water. Do not add additional chemicals or cleaning solutions to the cleaner’s water tank.\n  * Once the machine has heated up, turn on the steam function and apply the cleaning brush to the dirty areas of grout.\n  * Use a rag or mop to thoroughly dry up the residual water after steam cleaning.\n  * Steam cleaning can remove grout sealant along with dirt and mildew. After the tile has completely dried, apply [grout sealer](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Floor-Protection-Materials-Floor-Sealers/Grout/N-5yc1vZ2fkp9nuZ1z1t2lr) to protect the surface and prevent future stains.\n\nStep 4: Prevent Buildup on Grout\nClean grout regularly to prevent buildup of dirt and mold or mildew. Each week, pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cloth and wipe down the dirty grout and tiles. This kills mold and mildew spores and help keeps the tile and grout clean.\n\nStep 5: DIY Grout Cleaner\nMake your own grout cleaner. Most, if not all, of the ingredients you’ll probably find right in your cabinets. Here’s a few DIY grout cleaners you can try:\n  * Make a spreadable paste with 3/4 cup baking soda with 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Add more baking soda or peroxide if the mixture is too runny or thick.\n  * Put about two teaspoons of cream of tartar in a bowl. Add enough lemon juice to make a thick paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying paste.\n  * Mix equal amounts of plain water and baking soda to form a paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying this paste.\nOnce you’ve made your DIY grout cleaner paste, apply it to your grout. For best results, wait a few minutes before scrubbing with a grout brush or old toothbrush. Rinse. Repeat if necessary.\nKeeping your grout free of stains and mildew is an important part of taking care of your tile. There are several ways to clean grout, and you can even make your own DIY grout cleaner. Now that you know how to clean your grout, make sure to maintain the look with regular cleaning. Anytime the stains are highly resistant to cleaning, use a portable steam cleaner.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How can I use steam or bleach to clean stubborn grout?", "assistant": "Step 1: Apply Grout Cleaner\n  * Wear [gloves](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Rubber-Gloves/N-5yc1vZcb34) to protect your hands when cleaning grout and tile.\n  * Clean grout with a commercial [grout and tile cleaner](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products-Bathroom-Cleaners-Grout-Tile-Cleaners/N-5yc1vZcba0). Apply it to the dirty areas of the grout following the manufacturer's instructions.\n  * If you prefer cleaning grout with a DIY mixture, make a paste of 3/4-cup baking soda, 1/4-cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Apply the paste to the grout with a [grout brush](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Cleaning-Brushes-Scrub-Brushes/Tile-and-Grout-Brush/N-5yc1vZcb49Z1z0pidd) and scrub the grout. Grout brushes have compact heads and dense, firm bristles to help loosen the grime that builds up in the grooves.\n  * Do not use acidic cleaners as they may dissolve or pit the grout. Do not use waxy or oil-based cleaners as these can leave a film that will attract dirt and make future cleaning more difficult.\n  * Chlorine bleach may be used on white grout but will leach color out of tinted grout. [Oxygen bleach](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Products-Bleach/N-5yc1vZcb5b) is a better choice for preserving colored grout between tiles.\n\nStep 2: Scrub and Rinse Grout\nUse a [sponge](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Sponges-Scouring-Pads/N-5yc1vZcb3k), cleaning rags or [microfiber cloths](/b/Cleaning-Cleaning-Tools-Cleaning-Cloths-Microfiber-Towels/N-5yc1vZcb2l) to rinse and wipe each area after cleaning. Be sure no residue is left from the grout cleaner. If you are cleaning grout and tiles on a floor, mop the entire floor when finished.\n\nStep 3: How to Clean Grout with Stubborn Stains\nGive old or stubborn stains extra attention.\n  * For stains that regular cleaning can't remove, thoroughly mix 2 tablespoons of oxygenated bleach into 2 cups of warm water. Test the solution on a hidden area of grout to be sure it won’t discolor.\n  * Pour the solution over a small area of stained grout lines. It's best to work in small sections and make more solution as needed.\n  * Allow the cleaner to sit for up to 15 minutes to give the ingredients time to work, then scrub and rinse until all the cleaner is removed. Use firm pressure and make several passes over each grout line.\n  * Assemble and load the steam cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Use only water. Do not add additional chemicals or cleaning solutions to the cleaner’s water tank.\n  * Once the machine has heated up, turn on the steam function and apply the cleaning brush to the dirty areas of grout.\n  * Use a rag or mop to thoroughly dry up the residual water after steam cleaning.\n  * Steam cleaning can remove grout sealant along with dirt and mildew. After the tile has completely dried, apply [grout sealer](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Flooring-Supplies-Floor-Protection-Materials-Floor-Sealers/Grout/N-5yc1vZ2fkp9nuZ1z1t2lr) to protect the surface and prevent future stains.\n\nStep 4: Prevent Buildup on Grout\nClean grout regularly to prevent buildup of dirt and mold or mildew. Each week, pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cloth and wipe down the dirty grout and tiles. This kills mold and mildew spores and help keeps the tile and grout clean.\n\nStep 5: DIY Grout Cleaner\nMake your own grout cleaner. Most, if not all, of the ingredients you’ll probably find right in your cabinets. Here’s a few DIY grout cleaners you can try:\n  * Make a spreadable paste with 3/4 cup baking soda with 1/4 cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 tablespoon of mild dish soap. Add more baking soda or peroxide if the mixture is too runny or thick.\n  * Put about two teaspoons of cream of tartar in a bowl. Add enough lemon juice to make a thick paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying paste.\n  * Mix equal amounts of plain water and baking soda to form a paste. Fill a spray bottle with hydrogen peroxide and spray the grout first before applying this paste.\nOnce you’ve made your DIY grout cleaner paste, apply it to your grout. For best results, wait a few minutes before scrubbing with a grout brush or old toothbrush. Rinse. Repeat if necessary.\nKeeping your grout free of stains and mildew is an important part of taking care of your tile. There are several ways to clean grout, and you can even make your own DIY grout cleaner. Now that you know how to clean your grout, make sure to maintain the look with regular cleaning. Anytime the stains are highly resistant to cleaning, use a portable steam cleaner.

{"system": "You are a helpful DIY assistant.", "user": "How do I create a cozy nook at home?", "assistant": "Step 1: Select the Location \nWhile this will work for any area or room in your home, one of our favorite transformations is turning an unused corner into a reading nook. It’s super satisfying to give any room a fresh perspective while also creating a little space for yourself –  \nbonus points if the corner is near a window for natural light to read by.\nChoose a spot in the house where you can create a relaxing vibe. If your home is often busy, filled with family, or your space acts as your office during the week, carving out a little corner for yourself can help you unwind.\n\nStep 2: Define the Space \nBecause this cozy nook is being set up in a corner of a room, you want to make sure to define the space. Laying down a [rug](/b/Flooring-Rugs/N-5yc1vZarfm) in whatever style you prefer will not only create definition but will warm up the nook, keeping your feet comfy and providing support for furniture.\nTip: Don’t be afraid to pull the rug out from the wall a bit – this will make the nook appear like an intentional part of the room’s design.\n\nStep 3: Add in Seating \nNothing says cozy nook like comfy seating. A good [chair](/b/Furniture-Living-Room-Furniture-Chairs/N-5yc1vZc7py) can make it even easier to unwind with a book after a long day. Be sure to take the size of your space into account when adding in any seating.\n\nStep 4: Bring in a Bookshelf \nPerfect for housing all your favorite books as well as displaying plants, candles and more, a [bookshelf](/b/Furniture-Home-Office-Furniture-Bookcases-Bookshelves/N-5yc1vZc7o5) can also act as part table if your corner is quaint but small on space. Keep in mind that while any type of bookshelf will work, a vertical shelf will draw the eye up and make the space seem more open.  \nIf you’re looking for a new way to organize your books, try arranging them by color, and alternating between traditional vertical placement and horizontal stacks for visual interest. Add decorative objects among the stacks, using heavy objects for bookends, vases and plants for a bit of greenery and leaning frames for natural separation between sections.\n\nStep 5: Add in Details \nWhile natural light is always preferred for relaxing spaces, a good light is a must, especially for rainy days or evenings spent in the nook. A sleek [floor lamp](/b/Lighting-Lamps-Floor-Lamps/N-5yc1vZc7no) eliminates the need for a side table and can provide good overhead lighting for reading.\n\nStep 6: Pile on Extras \nOne of the most important elements of the nook: the cozy extras. When it comes to comfy [pillows](/b/Home-Decor-Throw-Pillows/N-5yc1vZc1ky) and [blankets](/b/Home-Decor-Throw-Blankets/N-5yc1vZcfae), pile on the details. This spot is meant to be as warm and inviting as you want it to be, so have fun with the colors and textures of the throws and pillows.  \nAdditionally, a corner often means there's not a lot of space for a couch or spacious seating. Adding in a plush pouf or ottoman can help you kick back and relax when your legs need a little extra stretch.\n\nStep 7: Inspiration\nLook for inspiration: The internet is full of inspiration for reading nooks – but you don’t have to limit yourself to just one search term.  \n  * Make a mood board: Save photos of rooms with throw pillows you like, chairs that look comfy and color schemes you want to emulate. Save them all to one folder on your phone or computer so you can create a mood board or look back at them when looking for items to furnish your nook.\n  * Narrow down the items you'll need: Since this is a small space, you don't want to overwhelm the area with too much.\n  * Use what you have: Try moving furniture from another room in the house to this area, and work from there.\nReinvent any corner of your home easily.
